# Drafter AI: Your Smart CLI Email Assistant

**Drafter AI** is a powerful, command-line based AI agent that revolutionizes your email writing process. Leveraging the capabilities of LangChain and LangGraph, this tool helps you generate high-quality emails, refine them with a human-in-the-loop feedback system, and save the final version directly to your local machine. Say goodbye to writer's block and time-consuming edits!

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Core Framework:** Python
- **AI Orchestration:** [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/)
- **Agent Logic:** [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph)
- **LLM:** Groq LangChain-compatible model

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- An API key for your chosen Large Language Model (LLM) provider (e.g., GROQ).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AryanGupta1211/Email-Drafter-Ai-agent
    cd Email-Drafter-Ai-agent
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install langchain langchain-groq langgraph python-dotenv
    ```

3.  **Configure your environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your LLM API key:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

### Usage

Run the agent from your terminal with a prompt for the email you want to create.

```bash
python drafter.py
```

The agent will then guide you through the drafting and feedback process.
